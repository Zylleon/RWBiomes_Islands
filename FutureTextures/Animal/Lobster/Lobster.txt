How big is it? About cat sized.
What does it eat? (is it a predator?) Eats anything it can.
Where does it live? All islands.
Does it spawn in packs? Yes
Other info-- good pets? shearable? do you want it to have a specific type of leather? etc. Crab chitin. Meat should use the custom lobster tail texture. 
If possible they should obey fences and be ranchable.
