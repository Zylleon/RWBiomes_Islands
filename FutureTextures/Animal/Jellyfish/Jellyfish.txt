How big is it? About pawn sized.
What does it eat? (is it a predator?) Predator of small to medium prey.
Where does it live? All islands.
Does it spawn in packs? No.
Other info-- good pets? shearable? do you want it to have a specific type of leather? etc. No leather should be given if possible. Utterly untameable. It should be slow moving but its attacks should almost instantly paralyze prey.
Should add an event called "Jellyfish swarm" where a huge amount of them spawn in quite hungry. Should clear the ocean of smaller (and maybe even bigger) animals.
